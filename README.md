# SwingPlayground

Run your custom swing components directly in IntelliJ without wasting your time running an aplication like 1000 times just 
to add some stuff to a button or buying the expensive JRebel LOL! and this is gold if you are developing a LookAndFeel for Swing/Java and you don't know a lot, well this already save me a lot of time when I was tring to draw the dashed lines so, here you go

Only works with simple swing components, yet. But it's awesome if you are playing with Graphics2D
